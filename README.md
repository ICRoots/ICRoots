ICRoots
# ICRoots

ICRoots is a decentralized lending platform where users borrow stablecoins (like USDT or fiat) using Bitcoin as collateral. Built on the Internet Computer (ICP), it features AI-powered loan matching, trust-based lending via soulbound NFTs, and automated Bitcoin custody infrastructure.

## Vision

Bitcoin holders shouldn't have to sell to access liquidity. ICRoots unlocks lending for BTC users through trust-based AI recommendations and decentralized custody on ICP.

---

## Problem Statement

Many Bitcoin holders lack access to non-custodial, trust-based lending platforms. Existing options are centralized, risky, or lack AI-driven support for safer loan decisions. ICRoots solves this by providing collateralized loans, AI scoring, and NFT-based trust levels.
